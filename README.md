## Overview of Project

### Purpose
	The purpose of this analysis for this challenge is to look at how diffferent campaigns performed in comparison to their launch dates and their funding goals.
## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

	As far as challenges or difficulties encountered. I would have to say that tinkering with the formulas a bit to get things right. I hope that as I continue to practice some of these functions such as CountIf, I will in time get better at this. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
	The first conclusion that can be made from looking at data set is that May and June yielded the most successful launch months. Second conclusion you can draw is that of the 1369 theater outcomes, 62 percent of those were successful. 
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
	Based on the dataset of Outcomes based on Goals, one can conclude that more campaigns were campaigns with funding goals of $1000 or less had the highest success rate. 
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
	A possible limitation of this dataset would be to list any backers who backed out possibly. Also our data set brings in goal amounts and pledged, but it could also be great to have data of campaigns that were actually funded.
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
	We could create a table or graph depicting what Countries had the highest percentage of success in funding campagains based on goals. We could also create a table showing average time of campgains and display accourding to countries.
